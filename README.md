## Basic Overview
<a href="https://tripla.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Tripla</a> is a platform to manage your trip in a simple and customizable way.

Make a list of places to visit during your trip based on different categories that you determine such as attractions, restaurants and nightlife.

It is recommended to sign in using of the 3 available providers (Google, Facebook and Github) before creating a trip or a template to be able to edit it or delete it later since only the creator could do those actions.

## Basic Example
Let's say you are visting Prague next month. You want to make a list beforehand of the attractions to visit and the restaurants you want to try.

Let's say for attractions, you care about the name of the attraction, the suggested duration to spend and how important it is to visit that attraction (priority).

Let's say for restaurants, you care about the name of the restaurant, the opening hours, the type of cuisine and you would like to add a link to the restaurant menu.

In that case, you need to create a template with the two sections and their attributes then use that template to create the trip with the actual data.
You could also check if an existing template created by you or any user is similar and could be used instead of creating one.

The video below illustrates the steps on the platform.
